## Introduction

Electricity is indispensable. From the lights in our room and to the screens of our electronic devices, we need electricity.

However, what if we suddenly just lose that power and everything goes dark?
This would be a total nightmare. No lights but only darkness. 

This is why we should study power-outages!

## Dataset

The dataset used in the analysis comes from the article "A Multi-Hazard Approach to Assess Severe Weather-Induced Major Power Outage Risks in the U.S." The data describes major outages in the states of the U.S. between January 2000 and July 2016.
